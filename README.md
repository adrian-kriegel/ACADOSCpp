# ACADOSCpp

`C++` wrapper to dynamically run `C` code generated by [ACADOS](https://github.com/acados/acados). Allows run-time linking against generated solvers.

## Usage

```cmake 
find_package(ACADOSCpp REQUIRED)

# ACADOSCpp is header-only but for portability, you may link against it.
target_link_libraries(my_target ACADOSCpp)
```

See test cases for code examples.

## Why? 

### Building

Currently, the best way to use ACADOS' generated code within `C++` projects is to create a custom build target, directly `#include` the generated headers, link/add source files, and use the code directly. This adds unnecessary complexity and makes it incredibly difficult to re-use the same code around different generated solvers without the use of macros and re-compilation.

### Interface & Usability

Even if you are fine with having the code generator as a compile-time dependency, the interface is meant for `C`, not `C++`. I assume that, if you are reading this, you have used the `C` interface, and you know what I mean.
